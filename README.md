# EtchPad by Etch

## Disclaimer

The stories, people, brands and products in this software development project are fictitious and any resemblance to real life occurrence is by pure coincidence. The developer of this project, as part of an academic portfolio, referred to and used various open source materials available online to create an interactive brochure website, all of which are credited at the end.

## Project Overview

This is a front-end web development project to showcase a premium stationery product called EtchPad by the limited company Etch.

Unlike top competitors which sell generalised stationery products, Etch dedicates effort to serve a market niche that appreciates premium and long-lasting products. Its sole product called EtchPad is an archive-grade / museum-grade notebook for drawing and note-taking.

As an emerging online retailer, Etch wants to establish an online presence before actively trading. Therefore, this project is endeavoured with a mobile-first approach with the aim of building an email list, increasing brand and product awareness and kickstarting web traffic flow.

### Company Goals
* Develop the website as part of a brand awareness campaign in preparation for the product launch.
* Create an email list for newsletter, promotions and notification for product launch.
* Establish an online presence before trading.

### Target Audience
* New or accustomed to using internet websites.
* Demographics of all ages that value high quality stationery for recreational, professional and/or academic purposes.
* Niche target of people that are quality conscious, collectors and gift buyers.
* Minimalist aesthetic.

### Design
Device Dimensions

* [The Bootstrap 5 Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/) uses predetermined device dimensions:
  * Extra small <576px
  * Small ≥576px
  * Medium ≥768px
  * Large ≥992px
  * X-Large ≥1200px
  * XX-Large ≥1400px
* This allows for a responsive and personalised website experience.

Color Pallette
* 54 open source images relevant to the product were sampled through [Palette Generator](https://palettegenerator.com/) to determine the most dominant colours. 
* The following were chosen as the main colors of the website:
  * Primary #24201E
  * Secondary #D0B7AA
  * Tertiary #F0EDE8
* The text color (Primary) against the background (Secondary) and tertiary colors passed the contrast test for legibility using a calculator by [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
* [Paletton](https://paletton.com/) was used to create variations of the primary colors above for stylistic purposes.

Typography
* [The Bootstrap 5 Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/#native-font-stack) uses a predetermined set of native fonts,
* Allowing for maximum compatibility while maintaining aesthetic coherence:
```
$font-family-sans-serif:
  // Cross-platform generic font family (default user interface font)
  system-ui,
  // Safari for macOS and iOS (San Francisco)
  -apple-system,
  // Windows
  "Segoe UI",
  // Android
  Roboto,
  // Basic web fallback
  "Helvetica Neue", Arial,
  // Linux
  "Noto Sans",
  "Liberation Sans",
  // Sans serif fallback
  sans-serif,
  // Emoji fonts
  "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol", "Noto Color Emoji" !default;
```

Logo
* [Original logo](https://looka.com/s/79844723) generated by [Looka](https://looka.com).
* Used the generated logo as inspiration to create a custom logo using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
* A handwritten font was chosen for the company name to associate it with the stationery niche.
* The slogan "HIGH-GRADE STATIONERY" conveys the durability of the museum-grade product. 
* It is capitalised in thin san-serif font to balance the extravagance of the logo.

## Project Development Stages

As a Prince2 Practitioner, the developer applied [Prince2](https://www.axelos.com/certifications/propath/prince2-project-management) project management methodology to complete the endeavour.

Project stages are outlined below to organise the development of features in para-sequential phases. 
This means that each phase produces a working set of deliverables with which the project can prematurely and beneficially conclude. 
However, the project can build upon completed features, and progress to the next stage if time and available budgets allow.

Each stage produces a working deliverable and is necessary for the next stage to begin.
Note that each stage is repeated three times: development for mobile, tablets and desktops. 
Stage X is commenced once all previous stages have been completed or suspended.
Each stage involves testing.
